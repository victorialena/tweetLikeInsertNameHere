436,It’s too early to tell if it’s permanent but the changes brought on by COVID19 are forcing many of us to reflect on what really matters in our lives
437,As has always been true at key moments in history it’s going to depend on young people to go out there and rewrite what is possible
438,I couldn’t be prouder of all the young people leading that change right now
439,Here’s my advice for the Class of 2020
440,We’ve seen the power that our voices have when we speak out about injustice––but we also know the toll that it takes on our mental health
441,Today I talked to Bryan Stevenson and activists about ways to keep our mental health a priority at this time
442,On National Gun Violence Awareness Day we #WearOrange to honor the victims and survivors of gun violence––which continues to disproportionately harm Black communities
443,Then keep speaking up voting and changing laws across the country
444,Third every city in this country should be a community
445,We have 250 cities counties and tribal nations working to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color
446,Join us
447,Second every mayor should review their use of force policies with members of their community and commit to report on planned reforms
448,We need mayors county executives and those in positions of power to make this a priority
449,Take the pledge
450,First there are specific evidencebased reforms that would build trust save lives and lead to a decrease in crime too
451,You can find clear actionable recommendations right here
452,Real change requires protest to highlight a problem and politics to implement practical solutions and laws
453,As I mentioned yesterday in our town hall there are several steps our mayors and elected officials can take right now
454,In our town hall yesterday I mentioned James Baldwins The Fire Next Time
455,From 1962 it remains a seminal meditation on race by one of our greatest writers and relevant for understanding the pain and anger behind the protests
456,Excerpt
457,And third an extraordinary essay by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the %US
458,Armed Forces Mike Mullen explaining the values at risk when we start using our military to control domestic protests

460,Here’s a useful read––a reminder of the importance of deescalation by police in their interactions with protestors
461,Let’s do this another way
462,Lets stop thinking our voice don’t matter and vote
463,Not just for the president
464,educate yourself and know who you’re voting for
465,And that’s how were going to hit em
466,Let’s get to work
467,I know the past few months have been hard and dispiriting
468,But watching the heightened activism of young people makes me hopeful
469,And if we can keep channeling our justifiable anger into peaceful sustained and effective action this can be the moment when real change starts
470,If you want to take concrete action but you’re not sure how we’ve created a site to connect you with useful resources and organizations who’ve been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years
471,The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away
472,So if we want to bring about real change the choice isn’t between protest and politics––we have to do both
473,We have to mobilize to raise awareness and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform
474,To do that we have to know which levels of government have the biggest impact
475,Changing the federal government is important
476,But the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels
477,The point of protest is to raise public awareness to put a spotlight on injustice and to make the powers that be uncomfortable
478,But eventually we have to translate those aspirations into specific laws and institutional practices
479,The protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decadeslong failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system
480,We should condemn the few who resort to violence––not the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support
481,Ultimately it’s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times
482,But I want to highlight some basic lessons from past efforts that are worth remembering

3904,I won’t be using mike lowery anymore as an alias
3905,On march 10th selena left for work and I stayed at the Westin as the receipts clearly showed with my friends nick and john before I left town
3906,Once again not at the four seasons
3907,We booked it for a couple days to stay for the defjam show but I bailed on the 11th to head back home
3908,The Pics I showed of me and Selena march 9 in Austin should make it clear that we were together that night and went from the venue to our Airbnb and never went to the four seasons
3909,This is our airbnb receipt where we crashed with our friends
3910,We have also confirmed with the Four Seasons regional manager that I was never on property on the 9th of March 2014 and never a guest on the 9th or the 10th and I welcome all press to inquire with them if needed or wanted
3911,Furthermore I stayed with Selena and our friends at an airbnb on the 9th and on the 10th stayed at a Westin because our hotel reservation at LÀ Quinta and not the four seasons was messed up
3912,Here are the receipts for the hotel on the 10th
3913,However I never stayed at the four seasons on the 9th or the 10th
3914,This person put another tweet up earlier saying they saw me at the restaurant the following night not the hotel
3915,The other reason this story might say I was staying at the four seasons was because a tweet from 2014 on March 10th not the the 9th says they saw me there
3916,This is that tweet
3917,Here is article that shows we didn’t arrive in Austin that night from Selena’s show in Houston until late in the night
3918,These photos clearly show me on stage with my assistant sidestage and the other with both of us in the streets of Austin afterwards on March 9 2014
3919,This article from 2014 talks about Selena being there with me
3920,As her story told I did surprise a crowd in Austin at Sxsw where I appeared on stage with my then assistant side stage and sang a few songs
3921,What this person did not know was that I attended that show with my then gf Selena Gomez
3922,In the past 24 hours a new Twitter appeared that told a story of myself involved with sexual abuse on March 9 2014 in Austin Texas at the Four seasons hotel
3923,I want to be clear
3924,There is no truth to this story
3925,In fact as I will soon show I was never present at that location
3926,Rumors are rumors but sexual abuse is something I don’t take lightly
3927,I wanted to speak out right away but out of respect to so many victims who deal with these issues daily I wanted to make sure I gathered the facts before I made any statement
3928,I don’t normally address things as I have dealt with random accusations my entire career but after talking with my wife and team I have decided to speak up on an issue tonight
3929,This is an action that can make change
3930,In 2020 it’s time to take back the power
3931,Join us as we work to register voters across the nation #MarchOnBallotBoxes

4714,It’s happening #friday
4715,big fan
4716,Keeping it positive
4717,Today is a good day
4718,When are we gonna be the kind of people that find joy in adding value to one another and not tearing each other apart
4719,And rather than try and make people feel accepted and loved you find things to pick apart like the world isn’t full of that already
4720,we can find something negative to say about anything or anyone
4721,And rather than being positive you belittle people
4722,Think about how awesome it felt for me to be on that stage after being away for so long the excitement and joy it gave me doing the thing i love the most i sang to to backtrack like most cameos do this is a normal thing
4723,imagine if you spent even half the time you spend laughing at other peoples expense actually building people up and encouraging people how much positivity you could bring
4724,What hurts about this is the fact that you have a platform to make a difference
4725,just saw a video of you ripping me to shreds saying I was lipsyncing
4726,They played the song and i just sang overtop of it
4727,regardless why spend your time tearing people down
4728,It’s People like you that are bullies at school that are making kids suicidal
4729,Thank you

5619,we have no choice but to stan
5620,i’m not explaining myself
5621,i’m supporting and trying to help encourage a solution
5622,instead of responding with your frustration that i totally agree with and support call your senators
5623,we need them to support this plan
5624,everyone deserves to be financially supported and feel safe at home during this time
5625,please support h
5626,6201 which has passed the house
5627,this bill will provide people w necessary financial support in terms of paid sick leave unemployment due to corona virus isolation prevention
5628,please contact your senate to support the passing of this bill
5629,urgently
5630,i am agreeing w yall
5631,these are the times when the world should rely on their governments to support the plan for all citizens to stay at home and lessen the threat of infection and the spread of the virus
5632,well some of us have to work
5633,i understand and entirely support your frustration
5634,i do not mean to disrespect anyone who doesn’t have the privilege of cancelled work or being able to call out of their work
5635,but this is a national emergency and a pandemic of global proportion
5636,if you have the choice if your work IS cancelled please try to be considerate of others
5637,that is all i meant
5638,this is what i’m talking ab
5639,yes
5640,for sure
5641,i am just asking the people that have the privilege of cancelled work to practice social distancing instead of deliberately making selfish choices that put others in danger
5642,like your hip hop yoga class can fucking wait i promise
5643,please
5644,they taught me this one years ago
5645,means suck my dick
